  What's a Reducer?
    It is a function that takes the current state and 
    an action that was dispatched as itâ€™s parameters and returns the new state.

// we can combine this reducer with other reducers later 
// and make a big object for the store 
// reducer should mandatorily return a state.

    //Actions are plain Javascript objects with a type property and a payload (optional)
    //This type property describes the event that is taking place 
    //in the application.

      return action.payload;  // here is an array of 100 obj's pushed into the store

      return action.payload;  // here's one post details obj now pushed into the store
