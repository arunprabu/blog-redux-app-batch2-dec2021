React Router DOM Setup 
----
  Step 0: 
    npm i react-router-dom

  Step 1: 
    Identify the URLs and the matching comp 

    localhost:3000/           - Home Comp 
    localhost:3000/posts      - Posts Comp 
    localhost:3000/about      - About Comp 

    Let's now setup the URL's in menu's in Header comp 

  Step 2: 
    Check, the URL will change. Now, let's load the comp in between header and footer.

    Create 3 comp's namely Home, Posts, About as fn comp's 


  Step 3: 
    For that to be setup, let's config the routes in App.js 
       <BrowserRouter>
          <div>
            <Header />

            <main className="container mt-5">
              {/* ideal place for us to have router config's  */}

              <Routes>
                <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                <Route path="/posts" element={<Posts />} />
                <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
              </Routes>
            </main>

            <Footer />

          </div>
        </BrowserRouter>

    Step 4: 
    ---
      Check the app. Components would be loaded in b/w header and footer. But, pages will still refresh. 
      Let's fix it.

      Replace all <a href> to <Link to>

      Check the app. You have an SPA.
